# Haptika_GalaxyGlove
The Galaxy Glove Kit directly takes advantage of specific gesture and proximity as a means of haptic exploration. Intentional gesture, mirrored in the premise of intentional making and completed action for assault survivors, plays a vital role in enabling embodiment and empowerment in the user. The expressive feedback is provided in an adaptable code sample that allows the user to enact change in a visual environment. The example was inspired to provide a sense of possibility, optimism, wonder, and playfulness. http://www.haptika.co/portfolios/the-galaxy-glove/
